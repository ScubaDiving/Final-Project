# Final-Project
This is my final project in Numerical Analysis Course. My goal is to reproduce a graph from Bergstrom's 1998 paper on the evolution
of behavioral heterogeneity, specifically regarding the Hawk and Dove game. The graph shows the mixed strategist fixation frequency
as a function of population size.

I'm using MATLAB, duh.

Contact me if you may want to use my simulation and having trouble understanting something there, and I'll gladly help.
